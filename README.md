🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Internship Project (Python)
This project is part of my internship assignment where I worked on the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to analyze the dataset, build a machine learning model, and predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.

📌 Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Handle missing and inconsistent data
Create and transform useful features
Train machine learning models to predict survival
Evaluate model performance and draw conclusions
Visualize key findings

📊 Dataset Overview
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including:

PassengerId: Unique ID
Survived: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, 3)
Name, Sex, Age: Personal info
SibSp, Parch: Family aboard
Ticket, Fare: Fare information
Cabin: Cabin number (may contain missing values)
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
⚙️ Installation & Setup
